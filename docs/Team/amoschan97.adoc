Current implementation

The purpose of this command is to list all bookings that have been added.


The following is an example usage scenario for the list command:
Step 1: User inputs list.
Step 2: The program fetches bookings from bookinglist. It iterates through the list and converts each booking in the list into a string.

Step 3: The list is printed to the user through the Ui.

I also wrote out the initial use cases for the developer guide
